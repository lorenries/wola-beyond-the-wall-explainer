            <p class="center">With Congress back in session, there are several bills concerning U.S.-Mexico border security and immigration that could soon come to a vote. These bills include an approximate $1.6 billion request for President Trump’s border wall, as well as requests to expand the law enforcement agencies that identify and deport undocumented immigrants. The Trump administration’s decision to phase out Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) will also likely influence how Congress handles these bills, which will be debated in the coming months as Congress works to approve the are supposed to be rejected or approved by October 1 along with the rest of the 2018 fiscal year budget.</p>
            <p class="center">Below are profiles of the various border security and immigration bills under consideration in Congress, including our assessment of what will likely happen next, our view of the proposed legislation, and our recommendations for what you can do to take action against these costly, divisive and ineffective proposals.</p>

                        <p>One of President Trump’s main 2016 campaign promises (PDF) was to build a “big, beautiful wall” along the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump added that he would compel Mexico to pay for construction costs.</p>

There have been signs that Trump is backing away from his pledge to build a wall along the border's entire coast-to-coast length. During a January conversation with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, transcripts showed Trump stating that the proposed border wall was “the least important thing that we are talking about.” Since then, Trump has made other public comments suggesting that building a 2,000 mile wall is unnecessary.</p>

                        <p>The Trump administration’s 2018 Customs and Border Protection budget request (PDF) asks Congress for US$1,571,239,000 to build 74 miles of border fencing, as a first step toward a much larger effort. (That’s US$21,232,959.46 per mile.) Sixty of these miles would cover areas of the border that currently have no fence. The 2018 request breaks down as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>US$784 million for 32 miles of new border wall in the Border Patrol’s Rio Grande Valley sector, in far southern Texas not far from the Gulf of Mexico.</li>
                            <li>US$498 million for 28 miles of new levee wall (a flood-control berm with fencing on top) along the Rio Grande river in the Rio Grande Valley sector.</li>
                            <li>US$251 million for 14 miles of “replacement secondary barrier” in California’s San Diego sector.</li>
                            <li>US$38 million for “planning for future border wall construction.”</li>

                        <p>In Congress, funding for border wall construction first appeared on the 2018 Homeland Security Appropriations bill (H.R. 3355, H.Rept. 115-239). The House of Representatives took the wall funding out of this appropriation and added it to a special bill, called a “minibus” (mini-omnibus, H.R. 3219), whichthat combinesd several funding bills deemed important for national security. The House passed the “minibus” on what was aa near-totally completely party-line vote on July 27. House Republican leaders refused to allow any consideration of amendments that wouldto strip out the border wall funding.</p>
